# Proof of Event (PoE)
## Payment & Consumption Model — v0.1

**Status:** Normativo  
**Scope:** Institutional / Economic  
**Applies to:** PoE Core v0.1  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how payments for PoE usage are handled in v0.1,
and how such payments are decoupled from on-chain token consumption.

This document does not define pricing, contracts, or commercial terms.

---

## 2. Separation of Concerns

### 2.1 Off-chain Payment

- Clients pay for PoE usage **off-chain**.
- Payment methods are outside the protocol scope and may include:
  - fiat contracts
  - invoices
  - SLAs
  - internal billing systems

The PoE protocol does not process, validate, or store payment transactions.

---

### 2.2 On-chain Token Consumption

- Token PoE (POE) is consumed **on-chain** as a technical unit.
- Token consumption represents:
  - usage of FIFO ordering
  - ledger growth
  - infrastructure load
- Token consumption may include:
  - burn
  - redistribution
  - platform allocation

The token is **not** used by the client as a payment instrument.

---

## 3. Role of the Platform

- The Platform acts as an economic bridge:
  - receives off-chain payment
  - accounts for PoE usage
  - consumes POE tokens accordingly
- The Platform may acquire POE tokens from any source.

Clients are not required to hold, manage, or transfer POE tokens.

---

## 4. Non-Promissory Nature

- POE does not guarantee access to services.
- POE does not represent a claim on revenue.
- POE is not redeemable.
- POE is a technical consumption unit.

---

## 5. Auditability

- Economic reports generated by the Platform may be hashed
  and recorded in the PoE ledger.
- This allows independent audit of usage and consumption
  without exposing off-chain financial data.

---

## 6. Versioning

Changes to this model require explicit versioning (v0.2+).

# PAYMENT — Modelos de Pagamento (Informativo)

O protocolo Proof of Event (PoE) não processa pagamentos.

Pagamentos pelo uso do serviço PoE são realizados **fora do protocolo**,
podendo ocorrer em:
- moeda fiduciária (fiat);
- criptoativos.

O pagamento autoriza apenas a **submissão de eventos** no FIFO via Plataforma.
Clientes finais não interagem com tokens POE.

O token POE é utilizado exclusivamente como unidade técnica interna de consumo
do protocolo.
